Population dynamics model using Bayesian statistics (JAGS in R)

This folder is composed about :

- 4 R-script that helped me to write my script, which are :
    - logistic model,
    - Koons's model (null model),
    - Henrick's model (dynamic model for the lynx) and
    - Gimenez and Charpron's model (dynamix model for the wolf)
      
- a Rmd-script with all of my dynamic models, composed about :
    - Exponential and logistic models applied on the wolf population in France with a projection on 2 years
    - Comparaison of this 2 models supported by the DIC
    - Simulations of population size following the previous estimated data
    - Simulations of adaptive management according to the harvest rate

- a R-script that counts the mean of the number of failures from the different management methods to be in the objective.
